# Jumplinks Component

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

**To do this challenge, you need a decent understanding of HTML, CSS & JavaScript.**

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out a prototype for a handy jumplinks component that can be used to anchor users to specific sections in the page (see video for basic example of how it should function).

For the purpose of this exercise you are free to hard-code any data/html in the template and use *lorem ipsum* for content.

You **don't** need to pull in the content of any sections/jumplinks from any datasource/api.

We are also **less concerned** with the visual style of the component at this stage as it's a prototype but feel free to add any styles you like.


## User Requirements

- Open the jump links navigation to see the set of links that they can 'jumplink' down to.
- On clicking those links it will anchor the page down to that section.
- The jumplink nav bar should stick to the top of the window when it reaches the top of the browser window
- The jumplink nav bar should unstick once the last jump-linkable section has been reached.
- The 'active' section should appear in the jumplink nav bar as they scroll.

**Requirements (extra)**
- If you have extra time it would be great if the user was able to see some visual element that shows their progress through the jumplinkable sections (see blue bar in video as an example).

## Tech stack requirements
- For JavaScript - vanilla JS
- For CSS - Please use either vanilla CSS, SCSS, or Tailwind CSS
- You are not allowed to use pre-made components - we want to see your own code.

## Assessment criteria

- Nice Semantic HTML markup.
- Clean, documented, well structured code
- Smart use of CSS features - think position sticky?
- Smart use of browser APIs - think Intersection Observer API

## Deploying your project

You can submit this to Github/Bitbucket along with any build steps or complete the task in an online editor e.g.  [CodePen](https://codepen.io/) or [Code Sandbox](https://codesandbox.io/)


**Have fun building!** ðŸš€
