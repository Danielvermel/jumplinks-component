## Technical Test 2

### Description

This project is part of an interview process and it encompasses one challenge [Technical Test 2 - Jumplinks Component](https://bitbucket.org/numiko/technical-test-2-jumplinks-component/src/master/).

#### Technical Test 2

The goal is to build out a prototype for a handy jumplinks component that can be used to anchor users to specific sections in the page (see [video](https://bitbucket.org/numiko/technical-test-2-jumplinks-component/src/master/Sticky-Jumplinks.mp4) for basic example of how it should function).

#### Requirements

- Open the jump links navigation to see the set of links that they can 'jumplink' down to.
- On clicking those links it will anchor the page down to that section.
- The jumplink nav bar should stick to the top of the window when it reaches the top of the browser window
- The jumplink nav bar should unstick once the last jump-linkable section has been reached.
- The 'active' section should appear in the jumplink nav bar as they scroll.

### Tech Stack:
